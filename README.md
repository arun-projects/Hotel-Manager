# Hotel Manager

In this project we will be creating a hotel property manager application using the front end created for you here. Your job is to make the functionality work as follows:

- Display all hotels on index.html.
- When the form in new.html is filled out and submitted, add the hotel and display the updated hotels on the index page.
- Show an edit form for a specific hotel when the edit pencil button is clicked. The template for this is edit.html.
- **Bonus:** Implement the delete button functionality on the edit page.
